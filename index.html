        <p>Flexbox is a layout mode that provides for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. For many applications, Flexbox can be used in place of floats. Flexbox layout gives complete control over the direction, alignment, order, size of the boxes.</p>
